## 🚫 Why does Bitcoin Safe block software seeds on Mainnet?

🤔 Isn't that inconvenient?

🔥 Turns out — it's a **major security upgrade**.

Bitcoin Safe **only allows software seeds on Testnet, Signet, and Regtest** — never on Mainnet. Here's why:

### ✅ Reasons why software seeds are blocked on Mainnet

- 🧠 **Software seeds are insecure** 
  - Computers are full of risks: clipboard hijackers, malware, browser exploits.
  - One slip, and your seed is compromised — it's game over.
  - Cold storage should never start hot.

</br>

- 🧊 **Cold storage must be born cold**
  - Users often generate seeds in software wallets then migrate to hardware.
  - But the initial exposure already happened — there's no going back.
  - True cold storage = created on a hardware signer from the start.

</br>

- 🎣 **Phishing thrives on software habits**
  - Typing seeds into apps trains you to trust bad UX patterns.
  - Hardware-only forces better habits and limits exposure.
  - ✅ Seedless Mainnet = fewer phishing victims.

</br>

- 🧪 **Developers still get flexibility**
  - Software seeds *are* allowed on:
    - Testnet
    - Signet
    - Regtest
  - Ideal for devs. No risk to real sats. 🧡

## 🛡️ Address poisoning protection

Bitcoin Safe **color-codes receive addresses** to make address poisoning obvious:

- 🟢 Green = verified receive address  
- 🟡 Yellow = change address  

If someone tries to poison your clipboard with a fake address, you'll see it instantly.

## ✅ Address verification via USB or QR

Verify receive addresses directly on your hardware signer — no need to trust the screen.
